Privacy policies.

You know, those things you agree to all the time when you download a new app or sign up for a new account? No? Well, chances are pretty good that you're beholden to at least a few of them.  Companies like Facebook and Google are collecting loads of data from your activity and making billions from it every day...and you told them it was okay when you checked that box and clicked `Accept`. I'm just as guilty as anyone else. I want to get into [Matchington Mansion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/matchington-mansion/id1216575026?mt=8) __now__, and I'm not letting 40 pages of legalese get in my way.  But once you start looking at these documents, you'll see that they're usually not insanely long and are usually plainly worded. I've usually made up my mind about whether I want to use a service before reading their Privacy Policy, but it's good to know what you're in for.

I think if more people actually read these thing, then there would be a more robust conversation about the impact we want internet companies to have on our lives.  We'll set aside the sentiment that people really don't care about their digital privacy because, while I agree that there are some, I believe that most internet denizens are uneasy with how companies profit from our behavior. The underlying feeling is one of dispondency. Most of us don't want Facebook to [give away our location data](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/facebooks-failures-and-also-its-problems-leaking-data/578599/), but we don't know that--much less how--we can prevent them from doing so. But that knowledge is usually found in a privacy policy document and like we said already, that's just a formality.

What if you didn't really have to read them, but could know just what it contains by reading a spec sheet?  Imagine reading a privacy policy like you shop for a new laptop:

> "hmm...let's see...I could use whizbng.com's todo app but I like gitrdon.io's UI a little more. Well, whizbng.com's sharing section is a level 0, they don't share any data with :air-quotes: partners"
